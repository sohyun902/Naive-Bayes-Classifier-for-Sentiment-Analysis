# Naive Bayes Classifier for Sentifment Analysis
There are two files for sentiment analysis. A NaiveBayesClassifier class was implemented in 'NaiveBayesClassifier.py'. 'NaiveBayes test.ipynb' is for testing the performance of the model implemented in the 'NaiveBayesClassifier.py'. You can get accuracy score of it by applying 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' files. Also, you can know how the accuracy of the model changes when the size of the 'train.csv' file changes through the .ipynb file.

## Use Guide
You may just run the 'Naive Bayes test.ipynb' file. Train, test, evaluation, and performance visualization can be executed through the file. Before running it, changing csv paths in second cell according to your environment is recommended.
